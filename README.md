# Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein divergence
This repository contains an implementation on pytorch of the unbalaned Gromov-Wasserstein divergence presented in the paper [The Unbalanced Gromov Wasserstein Distance: Conic Formulation and Relaxation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04266). It allows to compare weighted point clouds equipped with a cost matrix.
